# Solutions to Advent of Code 2025!

This will be a little different from my 2024 repository in that I will no longer be using the [python utility](https://github.com/gianpena/AoC24/blob/main/aocinput.py) I used last year for automatic input; instead, I will be using [this](https://gist.github.com/gianpena/4607700a88532303d744e4ea74c93974) to direct input like so:

```sh
advent 2025 1 | python sol.py
```

This means that my programs this year will also be utilizing standard input.

Additionally, if you are interested in obtaining sample inputs for the days, I have made a separate utility you can find [here](https://github.com/gianpena/aoc-example-input).
